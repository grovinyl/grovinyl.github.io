        <h2>Hello! My name is Leo!</h2>
         
        <p>I am an Information Technology B.S. senior at The University of Central Florida. 

            <br><br>I currently work as a Student Assistant at the Technology Lending Desk of the 
            UCF John C. Hitt Library. I also serve as a Resident Assistant for 
            incoming freshmen at UCF through the Department of Housing and Residence Life.

            <br><br>Through both of these roles I have realized a strong passion of 
            mine is helping others. I enjoy breaking down complex tech concepts into 
            digestible pieces and believe that every day at the help desk is another 
            opportunity to learn and teach something new.
